# Compiler-Design

1.Compute first- To implement the code for Computation of first of the given grammar

2.DFA string acceptance.cpp-To implement the code for acceptance of string by Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).

3.Design LA.cpp-Design a lexical analyzer for a language which consists of the tokens: <, <=, =, >=, <, <>,(,), +, -, *, /, := , ;, identifier, keywords, constants and literals( which are enclosed in apostrophes). Comments, which begin with /* and end with a */, and blanks are ignored by the scanner (that is blanks are treated as blanks separator only).

4.Left recursion removal.cpp-To implement the code for removal of Left Recursion.

5.NFA to DFA.cpp-To implement conversion of NFA(non-deterministic finite automata) to DFA(deterministic finite automata).

6.non determinism elimination.cpp-To implement the code for Elimination of non determinism from the grammar.
